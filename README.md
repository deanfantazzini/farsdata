# farsdata

This is the farsdata package which contains a set of functions designed to load fars data and plot them. More specifically, these data come from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's [Fatality Analysis Reporting System](http://www.nhtsa.gov/Data/Fatality-Analysis-Reporting-System-(FARS)), which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.
